NB (Alejandro): The use cases have been prioritized in the first sheet labelled "priorities" (original sheet can be found in second sheet). There are some which may already be done, and have asterisks next to the Use Case ID. Others may be duplicates, and have question marks next to the Use Case ID. Finally, there are some things Alejandro didn't understand about the use case, and these also have question marks (and questions).
