# Meeting with Alejandro, Eldiflor, and Dev's
- Went through user stories
- Reviewed current user stories and added more based on Alejandro's request
- Israeli sources should be called Sources
- BBC, NYT would be Referencing sites
- Twitter handles are Referencing handles
- Request for front page made available to public displaying essential data
- **Alejandro needs to post the list of Israeli news sources**
- Discussion of storing all articles and citations so that to give the largest sample
- Discussion of how to determine if a site is an Israeli news sources without manually entering it as a Source in the list
- Alejandro wants to get articles by date 
- Alejandro wants a record of breaking stories and changes on those specific articles over time
- Decided that we should move more quickly through user stories since we were running out of time
- Started going through new user stories Alejandro created
- TOPSY would be good to look into
- Asked to Alejandro - What is the objective?
- Answer (Abbrev.): To understand digital dissemination of Israeli news sources.  How are References using Sources (ie, embedded url, footnote, text only)? How do you measure if a story has gone taken off or "gone viral"? Generally how often do References citing Sources? What authors are doing it? Does traffic set the agenda and how is public opinion affected?  These are all things Alejandro would like to explore.
- **Next meeting Thursday May 28, 1pm at UTSG at BA in a undecided room.**


# Dev Meeting
- Compared the 3 projects and as a group decided that Voyage will be the project we use as our foundation.  This is mainly due to its use of the Newspaper but additionally since most team members are already familiar with the project.

## To Do
- The data gathering process has been started on Voyage and we will compile some useful data for Thursday.
- Voyage code should be added to the UTMediaCAT repo before the next meeting to give Paul and William time to read their code and understand the structure.
- Dev's who haven't already need to get an understanding of all the tools used in Voyage.  Newspaper, Django, etc.
